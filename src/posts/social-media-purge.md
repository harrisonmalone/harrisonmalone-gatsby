title: "Social Media Purge"

The end of my time using Facebook, Instagram and Twitter has arrived. This morning I deactivated all of my accounts associated with each service. I'll try to explain my reasons for this and what I intend to achieve because of this decision.

I've been a user of Facebook since 2009. I used it properly from 2010 - 2013. From then on it was all downhill. The service was in it's heyday in the later days of my high school education and first year at university. It was fun to be tagged in photos and get "cool" points because I was at certain events. Unfortunately, some of these photos were atrocious and should have never ended up on the public internet.

Groups were also a big hit especially in 2011 and 2012. These groups were active places for communication amongst my mates. They died out too. 

Then along came a service called Instagram. I used it extensively from 2012 - 2017. A good long run. I don't necessarily have a problem with Instagram apart from the crazy frequent ads that you get when viewing stories. I don't like the fact that they're owned by Facebook but it's not a deal breaker for me. I love React after all! 

I think the main problem with Instagram is time wasting. It's just an addictive app that many people go to when they're bored.

Last of all there's Twitter. I like the premise and simplicity of Twitter but it's just too toxic. Too many horrible terrible people posting stupid things. And again, the time wasted on the service is a killer.

I have thousands of tweets and images from Twitter that I've stored away on a hard drive.

So then where am I going to spend my time instead? Well I'm going to focus on reading, gaming and watching proper television shows (like Mr. Robot). I also can't really delete YouTube but I'll monitor and try to limit my intake of content there.

I'm also going to focus on my relationships with people. Being a good friend and being there for people when they need me.

One annoying caveat with trying to delete Facebook is not wanting to delete Messenger. Messenger has its flaws but I still rely on it to connect with a bunch of people in my network. Luckily, Facebook allows you to just deactivate (not delete) your account so that's what I've done.
