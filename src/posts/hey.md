I've been a happy customer since paying for the yearly [Hey](https://hey.com/) subscription a couple of weeks ago. I did the full free trial and when it came time to fork out the $146.40 AUD it was a no-brainer. It's an awesome product and I want to support great work done by an excellent development team that cares about software quality.

Something else I just noticed today is in [this screenshot](https://harrisons-shared-images.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/3747a633-8c20-44b4-a1bb-e8ec653651de). Hey is able to stop email tracking of apps like Mandrill and Hubspot which is amazing! I agree with Hey's stance on this; it's an intrusion on your privacy.
