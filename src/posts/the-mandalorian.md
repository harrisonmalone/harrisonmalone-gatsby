My favorite show of 2019 was [The Madalorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian). Viewing the finale of the season was a nice way to end the year after the massive disappointment of [The Rise of Skywalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker).

The show was just really awesome throughout. A strong start that introduced all the main characters from episode 1 to 3 got me hooked. There was then arguably a bit of a lull in terms of pulling away from the main Baby Yoda plot and just having Madalorian going for cool adventures around the galaxy. I was quite happy with the quality of these episodes; especially [The Prisoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_6:_The_Prisoner).

Lastly, the final two episodes gave us a great payoff with some heartbreak (Kuiil's death) and a perfect setup for the next season.

The show just had a nice balance to it. Its cinematography was similar to the 3 main Star Wars Disney movies (this is a good thing) and the writing was very tight. There was hardly any cruft and it was a show that was to the point. There weren't too many loose ends that were missed.

I think The Rise of Skywalker had very poor writing and severely tarnished Star Wars canon hence my very negative review of it.
