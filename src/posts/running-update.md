This will be a quick little update on my running. I'll also include what my current gear is and my training schedule. It's nothing too special so don't get your hopes up!

For staters, I'm not really training for anything particular right now. What I'm thinking of doing soon is a [Park Run](https://www.parkrun.com.au/) at Albert Park Lake. I've heard only good things about Park Runs and enjoy doing a sharp 5k. This isn't a particularly competitive meet, it's more of just a community event so I don't count this as training for something.

I will likely do [APSOC](https://apsoc.net.au/) again this season with the first run in April.

My training schedule reflects this lack of big runs. What I have decided is that on weekdays I need to be running mornings. I've long been a proponent of runs post work and I still believe I feel and train better in the afternoons. However, having the evenings to do other activities apart from exercising is a godsend. I can cook, catch up with mates, write blog posts, attend meetups; the list goes on. 

I just need to wake up and run a couple of kilometers and everything starts feeling okay. In the summers I also miss the heat which for me is becoming very important. I battle to get through runs where the mercury is pushing thirty plus.

The distances of my runs currently look something like this.

```txt
Tuesday 40 mins 
Thursday 40 mins 
Saturday 50 mins 
Sunday 1 hour 
``` 

This will give me a total weekly millage of around 40 kilometers.

I'm happy with this but the big thing to add would be a track session. I need to figure out a training group that's ideally based at Olympic Park.

I'll now get into my gear. 

First up is the watch. I'm using the [Forerunner 235](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/529988) which has been a great little device but honestly I'm ready for an update. I would love a watch with music so I could whack the AirPods in for a run. The heart rate sensor on the 235 is also subpar.

The watch has its flaws but its pure simplicity makes me happy. I have all my notifications turned off and just use the watch to tell time and track my runs. The battery life is unbelievably good which is the true selling point over the Apple Watch. I'll charge the watch on average once a week and I wear it all day everyday.

My runners right now are the [Nike Air Zoom Structure 22's](https://www.nike.com/au/t/air-zoom-structure-22-running-shoe-1KqM5f/AA1636-002) which I've worn now for about 2 years. They've been the best shoe I've ever owned. Comfy, heaps of cushioning, relatively light weight and a nice clean colour-way has me being a repeat purchaser.

I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking to get into some more serious running.
