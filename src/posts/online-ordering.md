Everyone has been doing a lot more online ordering lately. I wanted to quickly talk about a positive experience I had with online ordering this week. 

It was a simple purchase; a wireless mouse bought from JB Hi-Fi for my remote work desk setup. The checkout process was standard apart from one unique delivery method that they are doing. As far as I can tell, it seems that JB employees are now couriers as they can't work in stores.  

I ordered my product on Friday evening and it was scheduled to deliver on Monday via this delivery method. When the dispatch was initiated I got a [text message](https://harrisons-shared-images.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/b1be867a-7e48-4cc2-be27-785ee64c4aaa) which stated that the order was on its way. Nice! The text also contained a link to [track the order in real time](https://harrisons-shared-images.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/2ec3bfae-8580-4f55-9a7d-4e1852663d80) (Uber style) which I thought was really nice touch. 

When the order arrived I got a phone call from the JB employee asking me where I wanted the item to be placed. I wanted it in the letterbox.

That was it! Great work JB.
