title: "MacBook Air or iPad Pro?"
---

My iPad Pro that I bought in Santa Monica in August 2017 has started to show a bit of age. Its battery life is really shaky and the Smart Keyboard has stopped connecting all together.

Do I straight up get the new iPad Pro? It seems like a really nice computer. Then I look at the new MacBook Air and think to myself hmm that's nice too! I need to make a definitive list for what's better about the MacBook. 

The table below is listing the pros and cons of buying a MacBook Air.

|Pros                                                                   |Cons                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Certainly better for typing and just generally doing work              | Not switching contexts between work and home                |
|Install game emulators on that machine and it not being weird          | Maybe performance slower? Probably not a big deal           |
|Better in terms of messages                                            | Too be seen if I can fix texting issues                     |
|If I left work I'd have a useable computer for code                    | This is a massive pro arguably the biggest and most obvious |
|Journaling in plain text could be kind of freeing, already doing this a bit| Lose Apple Pencil support                                   |

Here are some other rambling thoughts:

- My phone becomes my iOS hub for things like WhatsApp and Messenger which I barely use anyway
- Means no more Apple Pencil wireframes, probably not doing many wireframes anyway
- The Mac would be very pure, use Apple Podcasts, Music and TV
- Very familiar with setting up the Mac and having it just the way I like it
- When im moving around the house put AirPods in and use iPhone for media
- Laptop will be fine to carry around and have a dining table and stuff like that
- Mum gets my iPad which is a nice thing to give away, despite it being old it does still work quite well
- Use only the Safari browser, have a nice setup with for YouTube which is the main thing I do on my iPad currently 

This is honestly quite a confusing decision to make. I love the iPad but I think a MacBook makes more sense!
