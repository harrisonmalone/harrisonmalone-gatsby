title: "Best Albums of the 2010s"
---

Since the start of the new year I've been wanting to do a quick list of my favorite albums over the past 10 years. I was inspired by this [Pitchfork piece](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-2010s/) that runs through a whole 200 albums; a little much for me. I'm going to do 15 albums and describe each album in a sentence or two. 

After making the draft list these were some of my general observations:
- I noticed that many of these albums are from the earlier part of the decade, I think this is because to truly appreciate an album it needs a good 2 to 3 years of maturation
- There's a 4 month time frame in 2012 where 4 of these albums were released, I remember this was the best few months of music where I was old enough to appreciate it 
- There are 2 artists with 2 albums which isn't ideal but I can't leave both albums off

## Twin Fantasy: Car Seat Headrest (2018)

Well recorded, emotional, gets you in the feels. Bodys and Cute Thing are such a strong back to back. The album is re-recorded but it's still great!  

### 14

## Cosmogramma: Flying Lotus (2010)

One word: banging. I played Do the Astral Plane many times when having drinks with friends and on road trips.

### 13

## Some Rap Songs: Earl Sweatshirt (2018) 

Earl's best album. The closest thing to Madvillian that I've heard since that album came out. Some would argue the beats are repetitive but I like them.

### 12

## 2: Mac DeMarco (2012)

I went through a big Mac DeMarco phase and this is by far his best album. A cultural icon in his heyday: clothes, music and laid back lifestyle were all things I imitated.

### 11

## Teen Dream: Beach House (2010)

One of the most versatile and consistent artists of the decade. Beach House works in any setting and is such a go to in my music library. This is their best album but only just; Bloom is a great listen as well! 

### 10

## Bon Iver: Bon Iver (2011)

One of the artists that got me into music that wasn't what my dad liked or what was on the radio. Calming music with enough experimentation to keep things interesting.

### 9

## Helplessness Blues: Fleet Foxes (2011)

What shaped a lot of my musical taste over the 2010s was [Anthony Fantano](https://www.youtube.com/user/theneedledrop) and this was his favorite album of 2011. I'm so glad I discovered this. The harmonies remind me of the Beach Boy's.

## 6 Feet Beneath the Moon: King Krule (2013)

Listening to this album makes you feel cool. Such an amazing blend of jazz and hip-hop. One of those albums that many of my friends collectively appreciated.

### 7

## This Is Happening: LCD Soundsystem (2010)

Dance Yrself Clean remains one of the best opening tracks to an album I've ever heard. Made me want to buy a synth and experiment with music. Simple and delightful.

### 6

## InnerSpeaker: Tame Impala (2010)

Memories of this album include playing it loudly out of my first car (a 1995 Suzuki Vitara) when driving away from my final high school exam. One of those albums that got me into music. The comparison of Kevin Parker's voice to John Lennon's also made me explore more of The Beatles music. 

### 5

## Channel Orange: Frank Ocean (2012)

I had a group of friends that were very into Odd Future at the time. Then this album dropped and we were all kind of like "what is this it's so different". Frank is a visionary; such a beautiful album.

### 4

## Good Kid m.A.A.d City: Kendrick Lamar (2012)

Released towards the end of my first year at university; just as I was getting into proper hip-hop. It blew me away. Played many times in my car and at parties over the entire decade.

### 3

## Blonde - Frank Ocean (2016)

After missing Frank Ocean perform live at Splendor in the Grass 2013 due to vocal issues he'd stayed rather quiet in the proceeding years. Then this came out; even better than Channel Orange it was ground breaking music and rightly tops many best of 2010s lists.

### 2

## Benji: Sun Kil Moon (2014)

This album is very different to a lot of the music I have above here. It's singer song writer Bob Dylan-esque magic. The stories that Mark Kozelek sings are so surreal but they are described so well. You can see all the events transpiring in your mind. You want to know more. Did all of this really happen?

### 1

## Lonerism: Tame Impala (2012)

As soon as I saw the [Lonerism trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9vWoPucA10) with Apocalypse Dreams playing over a psychedelic video of the band on tour I was sold. Done deal. I had the CD and I played it until it couldn't be played no more. It changed me and my tastes in music.
