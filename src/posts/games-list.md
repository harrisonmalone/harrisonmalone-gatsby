## Introduction 

Yesterday I went through a bunch of old games to decipher if everything still worked. In the end what I realized was how much I still love the PlayStation 2 and how I wanted to buy a couple of games for it. The PlayStation 2 definitely has the most emotional attachment for me and this is probably because I played it so much as a kid.

## Testing 

I went through each of the consoles I own testing to see if they worked. I didn't test every game but will get there eventually. [Here](https://gist.github.com/harrisonmalone/eaf90f6ff8159e0dbe9e36d29268cad1) is what I found.

## Plans 

Based on these findings I intend to basically neglect my other consoles and focus on collecting for the PlayStation 2. As the PlayStation 2 is backwards compatible I would also be able to buy PlayStation games as these are playable on the machine.   

Some games in this list have not been purchased yet including:
- SSX 3
- Burnout 3 Takedown
- Tekken 5
- Crash Bandicoot - Warped

I did think about building a custom PC to run Steam so I could play the Spyro and Crash Bandicoot remasters but this is massive overkill. The only thing I can't do is play the PC star wars games. These ideally would be purchased through Steam and run on a decent Windows machine.
