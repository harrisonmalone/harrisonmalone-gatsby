# Harrison Malone's Gatsby Blog

Lot's of time was spent over the past couple of days tinkering with stuff. Basically I wanted to properly learn a simple build tool for static sites. I wanted to use JavaScript. I started doing some learning with Eleventy but gave up quickly as their docs weren't great. I then remembered that I wanted to learn Gatsby and this was the correct choice. I love writing JSX and for me it's the best and quickest way to build a front end.

Really happy with the results. I'll have to try and write more from now on!
