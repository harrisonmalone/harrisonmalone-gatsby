Why is [afl.com.au](https://afl.com.au) using the [development build](https://harrisons-shared-images.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/86cbcd67-65ed-45c7-903d-6c5a979472d8) of React? I don't mind the current design of the site (other's would disagree) but it's very strange that they're not using the production build.
